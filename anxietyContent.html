  <body>
    <p>Anxiety is what we feel when we are worried, tense or afraid â€“ particularly
      about things that are about to happen, or which we think could happen in the future.</p>
    <p> Occasional anxiety is a normal human experience. But if your feelings of anxiety are very strong,
      or last for a long time, they can be overwhelming. You might also experience physical symptoms such as sleep problems and panic attacks.
