									<p>Positive inspirational quotes are good for people with depression to have on-hand.Depression can make life so gray that you aren’t sure where the sunshine is hiding or if it will return. Depression can bring you so low that you may wonder if positivity for depression is even possible, much less such thing as a positive depression quote that could lift you up again. But there are, and they can – if only a little.

										Reading some positive quotes when you’re depressed might, at the very least, distract you from depression’s pain ("Negative Thinking and Depression: How One Fuels the Other"). So, we’ve put together some positive inspirational quotes that you can read whenever you’re feeling down. We hope you find some relief in these positive inspirational quotes.

      Perhaps surprisingly, perfectionists can be LESS productive because the intense focus on perfection can lead to procrastination (or missing deadlines entirely!) and other success-sabotaging side-effects. Do you have perfectionistic tendencies? If so, what might you do today to allow yourself to enjoy a successfully imperfect day?

			This is a great quote to remember each birthday, or on days when you're feeling your best times just may be behind you. One thing I started doing for birthdays (and adding to on ho-hum days) is creating a "bucket list" of great things I still intend to do. What might be on your bucket list?

				Quran For Application In Life:
        In addition to the musicality of Quran that helps sooth the mind and cure stress, it is the meanings of Quran that can help a Muslim live life in a way that combats stress and cure it as well. In this regard, a Muslim can get the meanings out of Quran by learning the translation of Arabic into his or her particular language. Once that is done, one should try applying the instructions that Quran has given into life and then see the life change to a stress-free life. Some of the major verses in Quran that can help a Muslim create a stress-free lifestyle are as follows.
        Life is a Test – A Muslim must realize that all the life and its ups and downs are a test for a Muslim. the goods of it and the bad all are a test and a Muslim has to try to remain grateful in the former and steadfast in the latter. As Allah says in Quran:
        <center><img src="https://i1.wp.com/islamphotos.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/81de61753610bd7624cd82f74db0bd98.gif?zoom=2.625&w=755" alt="" height="400px" width="400"></center>
        “Be sure We will test you with something of fear and hunger, some loss in goods or lives, but give glad tidings to those who are steadfast, who say when afflicted with calamity: To God we belong and to him is our return. They are those on who (Descend) blessings from God and mercy and they are the ones that receive guidance.” (2:155)
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				It is clear from the ayah that those who acknowledge life as a test and in this test remain steadfast in the different adversities of this life are the ones who will receive blessings from Allah. Thus, when a person has such an attitude towards life, it naturally becomes stress free and whatever stress is present in it gets cured.
        Have Faith – In Quran, Allah Almighty describes the condition of the people who do not have faith, or who do proclaim faith but do not believe in it from their heart in the following way:
				<center><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DGfbmz_XcAAY2rQ.jpg" alt="" height="400px" width="400"></center>
			  “In their heart there is a disease and God has increased their disease and grievous is their penalty because they lie to themselves.” (2:10)

				This disease that people have in their heart for not believing in Allah, this disease is increased by Allah by putting themselves in all sorts of problems, hence the presence of stress in their heart and mind. The way to combat this is by believing in Allah Almighty. When a Muslim believes in His power and Supremacy then the heart grows strong in faith and the more strong it gets the more resilient to faith it becomes.
