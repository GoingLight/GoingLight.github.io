					  <p> Occasional anxiety is a normal human experience. But if your feelings of anxiety are very strong,
					    or last for a long time, they can be overwhelming. You might also experience physical symptoms such as sleep problems and panic attacks.

					<button class="accordion">Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>A person feels anxious on most days, worrying about lots of different things, for a period of six months or more.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">Social anxiety</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>A person has an intense fear of being criticised, embarrassed or humiliated,
					    even in everyday situations, such as speaking publicly,
					    eating in public, being assertive at work or making small talk.
					  </p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">Specific phobias</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>A person feels very fearful about a particular object or situation and may go to great lengths to avoid it,
					    for example, having an injection or travelling on a plane. There are many different types of phobias such as:
					  </p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Arachnophobia</strong></li>
							<p>Arachnophobia is the fear of spiders and other arachnids. This phobia is quite common,
								affecting as many as 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men. The sight of a spider can trigger a fear response,
								 but in some cases, simply an image of an arachnid or the thought of a spider can lead to feelings of overwhelming fear and panic.
							</p>
							<li><strong>Ophidiophobia</strong></li>
							<p>Ophidiophobia is the fear of snakes. This phobia is quite common and often attributed to evolutionary causes,
								 personal experiences, or cultural influences.</p>
							<p>Some suggest that since snakes are sometimes poisonous,
								 our ancestors who avoided such dangers were more likely to survive and pass down their genes. In a study of 35 snake-fearful participants, however,
								 researchers found that only 3 of these individuals had ever been bitten by a snake.
								 In fact, the majority of the participants had little or no direct experiences with snakes in any capacity.
							</p>
							<li><strong>Acrophobia</strong></li>
							<p>Acrophobia, or the fear of heights, impacts an estimated 23 million adults.
								This fear can lead to anxiety attacks and avoidance of high places.
								People who suffer from this phobia may go to great lengths to avoid high places such as bridges, towers, or tall buildings.
							</p>
							<li><strong>Aerophobia</strong></li>
							<p>Aerophobia, or the fear of flying, affects an estimated 8 million U.S. adults despite the fact that
								airplane accidents are actually very uncommon.
								 Around 1 out of every 3 people has some level of fear of flying.
							Some of the common symptoms associated with this phobia include trembling, rapid heartbeat, and feeling disoriented.
							</p>
					</ul>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">Panic disorder</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>A person has panic attacks, which are intense, overwhelming and often uncontrollable feelings of anxiety
					    combined with a range of physical symptoms. Someone having a panic attack may experience shortness of breath,
					    chest pain, dizziness and excessive perspiration. Sometimes, people experiencing a panic attack think they are
					    having a heart attack or are about to die. If a person has recurrent panic attacks or persistently fears
					     having one for more than a month, they're said to have panic disorder.

								<h4>Panic attacks</h4>
								<p>Panic attacks are a type of fear response.
									They're an exaggeration of your body's normal response to danger, stress or excitement.</p>
								<p>During a panic attack physical symptoms can build up very quickly, including:</p>
								<span id="one">...</span><span id="two">
								<ul>
									<li>a pounding heartbeat or chest pains</li>
									<li>sweating and nausea (feeling sick)</li>
									<li>shaky limbs, or feeling like your legs are turning to jelly</li>

								<h4>Suicidal feelings</h4>
								<p>Many people experience suicidal thoughts and feelings at some point in their lifetime.
									They can be very unpleasant, intrusive and frightening, but having thoughts about suicide
									doesn't necessarily mean that you intend to act on them. Most people don't go on to attempt to take their own lives.</p>
								<span id="ssatu">...</span><span id="sdua">
								<p>However, if you feel you may act on suicidal feelings and
									become unable to keep yourself safe then this a mental health emergency.
									It's important to treat it as seriously as you would any physical health emergency, and seek urgent help</p>

								<h4>Psychosis</h4>
								<p>Psychosis (also called a psychotic experience or psychotic episode) is when you perceive or
									interpret reality in a very different way from people around you. The most common types of psychosis are:</p>
								<span id="satu">...</span><span id="dua">
								<ul>
									<li>hallucinations, such as hearing voices or having visions</li>
									<li>delusions, such as paranoia or delusions of grandeur</li>

									or live with it most of the time.  It's also possible to have a psychotic experience
									without ever being diagnosed with a particular mental health problem</p>

						<header class="showcase">
							<ol>
							<li>Environmental factors: </li>
							<p> Elements in the environment around an individual can increase anxiety.
								Stress from a personal relationship, job, school, or financial predicament can
								contribute greatly to anxiety disorders. Even low oxygen levels in high-altitude
								 areas can add to anxiety symptoms.
							</p>
							<li>Genetics: </li>
							<p>People who have family members with an anxiety disorder are more likely to have one themselves.
							</p>
							<li>Medical factors: </li>
							<p>Other medical conditions can lead to an anxiety disorder,
								such as the side effects of medication, symptoms of a disease,
								or stress from a serious underlying medical condition that may not directly trigger
								the changes seen in anxiety disorder but might be causing significant lifestyle adjustments,
								pain, or restricted movement.
							</p>
							<li>Brain chemistry:  </li>
							<p>Stressful or traumatic experiences and genetic factors can alter brain structure
								and function to react more vigorously to triggers that would not previously have caused anxiety.
								Psychologists and neurologists define many anxiety and mood disorders as disruptions to hormones
								and electrical signals in the brain.
							</p>
							<li>Use of or withdrawal from an illicit substance:  </li>
							<p>The stress of day-to-day living combined with any of the above
								 might serve as key contributors to an anxiety disorder.
