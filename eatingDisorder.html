									<p>Healthy eating behaviour is based on two sensations: hunger and satiety.
										 Eating disorders disrupt this mechanism.
                  This disturbance is a physiological consequence of malnutrition and can be reversed if diet is improved.
									There is no single main cause of eating disorders. Several factors are generally at the root of eating disorders,
									 comprising a combination of genetic and psychological factors, problems within the family circle and/or the cultural and
									social environment. This disorder is therefore often the expression of a deeper malaise which the afflicted person feels
									 unable to control and strives to control his/her body weight by way of compensation.

									</p>

									<p>  It is estimated
                  that 9% to 10% of adult women suffer from compulsive-type eating problems. Men represent 10% to 15% of people affected by
	                 an eating disorder. These disorders are very often triggered during adolescence. Common eating disorders include anorexia
	                 nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder. </p>

										  <h2>Facts</h2>
											<p>Evidence also suggests that medications such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, or mood
												stabilizers may also be helpful for treating eating disorders and other co-occurring illnesses
                        but Treatment plans are tailored to individual needs and may include one or more of the following:
											(1) Individual, group, and/or family psychotherapy (2)Medical care and monitoring (3)Nutritional counseling
                       (4)Medications. Malaysian university students upon a study have concluded that approximately one in every five students were at
											 risk for developing eating disorders. Common SYMPTOMS of eating disorders include:
